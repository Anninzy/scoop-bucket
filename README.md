# Annin's Scoop Bucket

[![Tests](https://github.com/Anninzy/scoop-bucket/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Anninzy/scoop-bucket/actions/workflows/ci.yml) [![Excavator](https://github.com/Anninzy/scoop-bucket/actions/workflows/excavator.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Anninzy/scoop-bucket/actions/workflows/excavator.yml)

Annin's personal bucket for [Scoop](https://scoop.sh), the Windows command-line installer.

## Notes

I noticed some buckets (specifically https://github.com/okibcn/ScoopMaster) that takes manifests of other buckets and merge those into itself so as it is a giant bucket and users only need to add one bucket. This is why you may see manifests that are exactly the same on https://scoop.sh/#/apps. To be honest, I don't really see a point in this other than cluttering up the search results. Plus, these manifests are sometimes, for some reason, not up to date, but what can I do about it.

## Credits

Thanks to kamack38 for their Chocolatey package for [Valorant](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/valorant), used their download url and install arguments to write the VALORANT manifest.
