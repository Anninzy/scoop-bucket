# Annin's Scoop Bucket

[![Tests](https://github.com/Anninzy/scoop-bucket/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Anninzy/scoop-bucket/actions/workflows/ci.yml) [![Excavator](https://github.com/Anninzy/scoop-bucket/actions/workflows/excavator.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Anninzy/scoop-bucket/actions/workflows/excavator.yml)

Annin's personal bucket for [Scoop](https://scoop.sh), the Windows command-line installer.

> [!WARNING]
> VencordInstallerCli, VALORANT, and Roblox-Studio aren't really tested out, I would advise against using these manifests for now.

## Notes

I noticed some buckets (specifically https://github.com/okibcn/ScoopMaster) that takes manifests of other buckets and merge those into itself so that it becomes a giant bucket and users only need to add one bucket. This is why there are identical manifests on https://scoop.sh/#/apps. I personally don't see a point in this other than cluttering up the search results and causing confusion. Plus, these manifests are sometimes, for some reason, not up to date.

## Credits

- Thanks to kamack38 for their Chocolatey package for [VALORANT](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/valorant), their download URL and install arguments were used to write the VALORANT manifest.
- LibreWolf-np derived from the manifest on the official bucket.
